# DrivenData_Richters_Predicted_Building_damage
Hackathon on DrivenData

Based on aspects of building location and construction, the goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. 

The dataset was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:
 - 1 represents low damage
 - 2 represents a medium amount of damage
 - 3 represents almost complete destruction
